# Sequence in matrix

## Description
We are given a matrix of strings of size `N x M`. Sequences in the matrix we define as sets of several neighbour elements located on the same line, column or diagonal.
Write a program that finds the longest sequence of equal strings in the matrix and prints its length.

## Input
- On the first line you will receive the numbers **N** and **M** separated by a single space
- On the next **N** lines there will be **M** strings separated with spaces - the strings in the matrix

## Output
- Print the length of the longest sequence of equal equal strings in the matrix

## Constraints
- 3 <= **N**, **M** <= 128
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
