/* Porblem 20. Variations of set
   Write a program that reads two numbers N and K and generates all the variations of K elements from the set [1..N].
   Sample tests:
    N 	    K 	    result
    3 	    2 	    {1, 1}
                    {1, 2}
                    {1, 3}
                    {2, 1}
                    {2, 2}
                    {2, 3}
                    {3, 1}
                    {3, 2}
                    {3, 3}          */
