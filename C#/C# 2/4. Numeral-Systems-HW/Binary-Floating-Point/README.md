# Binary floating-point

## Description
Write a program that shows the internal binary representation of given 32-bit signed floating-point number in IEEE 754 format (the C# type `float`).

## Input
- On the only line you will receive a decimal number - **N**

## Output
- Print the its binary representation on a single line
  - There should not be leading zeros

## Constraints
- 1 <= **N** <= 10<sup>19</sup>
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**

_Example:_

| number | sign | exponent |         mantissa        |
|:------:|:----:|:--------:|:-----------------------:|
| -27,25 | 1    | 10000011 | 10110100000000000000000 |
