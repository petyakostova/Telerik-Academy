# Adding polynomials

## Description
Write a method that adds two polynomials.
Represent them as arrays of their coefficients.
Write a program that reads two polynomials and prints their sum.

## Input
- On the first line you will receive the number **N**
- On the second line you will receive the first polynomial as coefficients separated by spaces
- On the third line you will receive the second polynomial as coefficients separated by spaces

## Output
- Print the sum of the polynomials

## Constraints
- 1 <= **N** <= 1024
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**

## Sample tests

| Input | Output |
|:-----:|:------:|
| 3<br>5 0 1<br>7 4 -3 | 12 4 -2 |

_Example explanation:_

x<sup>2</sup> + 5 = `1`x<sup>2</sup> + `0`x + `5`	=>	{`5`, `0`, `1`}

-3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x + 7 = `-3`x<sup>2</sup> + `4`x + `7`	=>	{`7`, `4`, `-3`}

(x<sup>2</sup> + 5) + (-3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x + 7) = (-2x<sup>2</sup> + 4x + 12) = `-2`x<sup>2</sup> + `4`x + `12`	=>	{`12`, `4`, `-2`}
