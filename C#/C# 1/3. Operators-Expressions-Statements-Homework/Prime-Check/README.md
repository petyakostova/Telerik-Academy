# Prime check

## Description
Write a program that reads an integer **N** (which will always be less than **100** or equal) and uses an expression to check if given **N** is prime (i.e. it is divisible without remainder only to itself and 1).
  - _Note: You should check if the number is positive_


## Input
- On the only input line you will receive the number **N**.

## Output
- Output **true** if the number is prime and **false** otherwise.

## Constraints
- **N** will always be a valid 32-bit integer number, which will be less than **100** or equal.
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **8MB**
