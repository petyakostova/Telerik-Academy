# Randomize the Numbers 1...N

## Description
*	Write a program that enters in integer `n` and prints the numbers `1, 2, …, n` in random order.

## Examples

| n                 | randomized numbers 1…n |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| 3                 | 2 1 3                  |
| 10                | 3 4 8 2 6 7 9 1 10 5   |

_Note: The above output is just an example. Due to randomness, your program most probably will produce different results. You might need to use arrays._
