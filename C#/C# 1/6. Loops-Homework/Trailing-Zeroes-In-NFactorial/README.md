# Trailing 0 in N!

## Description
Write a program that calculates with how many **zeroes** the factorial of a given number **N** has at its end.
  - Your program should work well for very big numbers, e.g. **N** = 100000.
  
## Input
- On the only input line, you will receive a single integer - the number **N**

## Output
- Output a single number - the count of trailing zeroes for the **N!**

## Constraints
- **N** will always be a valid positive integer number.
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
