# Play with the VS Debugger

## Description
- Write a program that prints at the console the numbers from `1 to 1000`, each at a separate line.
- You might need to learn how to use loops (search in Internet).
- Set a breakpoint in the line, which prints the next number in the Visual Studio code editor. Run the program through the debugger using the `[F5]` key. When the debugger stops at the breakpoint trace the code execution with `[F10]` key.

## Submission
