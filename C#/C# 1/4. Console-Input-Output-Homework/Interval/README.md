## Description
- Write a program that reads two positive integer numbers **N** and **M** and prints how many numbers exist between them such that the reminder of the division by **5** is **0**.

## Input
- On the first two lines you will receive two integers - **N** on the first and **M** on the second.

## Output
- Output a single value - the amount of numbers divisible by **5** without remainder.

## Constraints
- 0 <= **N** <= **M** <= 2000
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **8MB**
