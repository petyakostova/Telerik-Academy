# Falling Rocks

## Description
- Implement the "Falling Rocks" game in the text console.
	- A small dwarf stays at the bottom of the screen and can move left and right (by the arrows keys).	
	- A number of rocks of different sizes and forms constantly fall down and you need to avoid a crash.	
	- Rocks are the symbols `^, @, *, &, +, %, $, #, !, ., ;, -` distributed with appropriate density. The dwarf is `(O)`.
- Ensure a constant game speed by `Thread.Sleep(150)`.
- Implement collision detection and scoring system.
