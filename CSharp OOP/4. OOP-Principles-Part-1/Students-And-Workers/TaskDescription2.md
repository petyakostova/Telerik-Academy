Problem 2. Students and workers

Define abstract class `Human` with first name and last name. 
Define new class `Student` which is derived from `Human` and has new field – `grade`. 
Define class `Worker` derived from `Human` with new property `WeekSalary` and `WorkHoursPerDay` and method `MoneyPerHour()` 
	that returns money earned by hour by the worker. 
Define the proper constructors and properties for this hierarchy.
Initialize a list of 10 students and sort them by grade in ascending order (use LINQ or `OrderBy()` extension method).
Initialize a list of 10 workers and sort them by money per hour in descending order.
Merge the lists and sort them by first name and last name.
